#### <p align="center">A tool to optimize code for AI prompting.</p><br>

ShortScript is an AutoHotkey script that removes comments, blank lines, and leading/trailing spaces from a selected JavaScript code. This reduces the character size and makes it easier to copy and paste into prompts for AI applications such as ChatGPT or Bing AI.

## How to Use

- Install AutoHotkey on your system.
- Run the script by double-clicking or right-clicking on the .ahk file.
- Select a JavaScript code with your mouse or keyboard and press Win+C to copy a shortened version to your clipboard.
- Paste the shortened code wherever you want.

## Features and Limitations

- The script currently only works well for JavaScript code. It does not remove comments from other languages such as Python or HTML.
- A possible improvement would be to detect the code syntax and apply different rules for different languages.
