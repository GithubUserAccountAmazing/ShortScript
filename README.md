#### <p align="center">A tool to optimize code for AI prompting.</p><br>

ShortScript is a simple and handy tool that helps you prepare your JavaScript code for using it in AI applications. It does two things:

- It minifies your code by removing comments, blank lines, and spaces. This reduces the size of your code and makes it easier to copy and paste into AI applications like ChatGPT or Bing AI.
- It wraps your code with codeblock syntax (triple backticks) to help make your prompt clearer and easier for the AI to understand.

For example, this is how ShortScript transforms a basic JavaScript code that uses comments, blank lines, and good formatting:

## How to Use

- Install AutoHotkey on your system.
- Run the script by double-clicking or right-clicking on the .ahk file.
- Select a JavaScript code with your mouse or keyboard and press Win+C to copy a shortened and wrapped version to your clipboard.
- Paste the shortened and wrapped code wherever you want.

## Features and Limitations

- The script currently works best for JavaScript code. Other languages may have different comment symbols that the script does not remove.
- A future enhancement could be to automatically detect the code language and apply the appropriate rules.
