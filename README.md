#### <p align="center">A tool to optimize code for AI prompting.</p><br>

ShortScript is an AutoHotkey script that performs two tasks on a selected JavaScript code:

- It removes comments, blank lines, and spaces to make it smaller and easier to copy and paste into AI applications like ChatGPT or Bing AI.
- It adds codeblock syntax (triple backticks) to help make your prompt clearer and easier for the AI to understand.

## How to Use

- Install AutoHotkey on your system.
- Run the script by double-clicking or right-clicking on the .ahk file.
- Select a JavaScript code with your mouse or keyboard and press Win+C to copy a shortened and wrapped version to your clipboard.
- Paste the shortened and wrapped code wherever you want.

## Features and Limitations

- The script works best for JavaScript code. Other languages may have different comment symbols that the script does not remove.
- A future enhancement could be to automatically detect the code language and apply the appropriate rules.
